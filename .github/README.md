# [Oppia](https://www.oppia.org) [![End-to-End and Lighthouse CI performance tests](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/actions/workflows/e2e_and%20lighthouse_performance_tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/actions/workflows/e2e_and%20lighthouse_performance_tests.yml)

Oppia is an online learning tool that enables anyone to easily create and share interactive activities (called 'explorations'). These activities simulate a one-on-one conversation with a tutor, making it possible for students to learn by doing while getting feedback.

In addition to developing the Oppia platform, the team is also developing and piloting a set of free and effective [lessons](https://www.oppia.org/fractions) on basic mathematics. These lessons are targeted at learners who lack access to educational resources.

Oppia is written using Python and AngularJS, and is built on top of Google App Engine.
